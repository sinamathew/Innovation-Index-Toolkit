*Scaling Solutions*

# Innovation Index Toolkit
A web-based form where users answer a set of questions and immediately receive a
**visualized score report** (e.g., a bar chart or radar chart).
The goal is to create a **seamless and interactive experience**, allowing users to **self-assess** their
innovation capabilities while providing HYBR with valuable insights.

**Objectives**

    ● Build a **dynamic web form** for users to answer innovation-related questions.

    ● Develop a **scoring system** to calculate users’ innovation index scores.

    ● Display results in an **interactive chart** (bar graph, radar chart, or any effective visualization).
